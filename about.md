I have been living in Indiana, USA for the majority of my life and have never travelled outside of the US. I hope to one day go to Manchester, UK to see Manchester United play at Old Trafford.

I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science from Manchester University. I have worked on various projects using PHP, Objective-C and C#, but my current favorite language is JavaScript. With it, I work on enterprise web apps for [NextGear Capital](http://www.nextgearcapital.com/).

When I'm not coding, I like to spend time with my wife, play Destiny on PS4, and hang out in IRC rooms -- usually chatting about AngularJS and whatever else is the technology of the week.
