I am back! I am trying to get into the habit of putting up a post at least once a week...for a whole year straight! I have been wanting to do this for a while, but never really pushed myself until now. I was spurred on by [Developer Tea, episode #21](https://www.developertea.com/episodes/7976), which talked about the top 1% of developers and their habits. I highly recommend this podcast, along with [JavaScript Jabber](http://devchat.tv/js-jabber), if you are into that.

Look for more content soon!
